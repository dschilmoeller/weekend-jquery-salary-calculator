# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration 1 weekend_

Jquery based salary calculator. Must be run locally from provided files in this repo.

Webpage takes in multiple employee values (all are required) and generates a total monthly cost of their salaries. If the total goes over a figure (currently hardcoded at 20,000) alerts user with visual style change.

Data table is generated dynamically but is not saved between page refreshes.

Individual employees can be removed via a delete button, with the total monthly costs being recalculated as appropriate at that time.
